The reference character is seated on a comfortable couch, holding a smartphone with a surprised and slightly confused expression. Her eyebrows are raised, and her mouth is slightly open, reflecting her disbelief. Around her, the room is filled with everyday items: a coffee table with a mug, a few scattered books, and a potted plant in the corner. The camera angle is slightly over-the-shoulder, focusing on the phone screen, which displays a notification with a bank's logo that she doesn't recognize. The mood is a mix of curiosity and caution, capturing the essence of receiving an unexpected message.",
