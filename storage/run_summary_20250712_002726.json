The character is seated on a comfortable couch, casually dressed in a rust-colored t-shirt and dark blue jeans, holding a smartphone. Her expression is one of surprise and slight confusion as she reads a scam text message supposedly from a bank she doesn't use. The room is decorated with a few potted plants and a coffee table in front of her, creating a relaxed atmosphere. A window in the background lets in natural light, casting gentle shadows across the room. The camera angle is slightly over-the-shoulder, capturing both her reaction and the phone screen, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the message.",
