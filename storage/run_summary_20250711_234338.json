The character stands in the center, holding a smartphone, with a puzzled and slightly amused expression. Her eyes are wide, and her eyebrows are raised, highlighting her surprise. The room is warmly decorated with a comfy couch, a small coffee table, and a potted plant by the window, through which soft daylight filters in. The focus is on the smartphone screen she holds, displaying an obvious scam text message from a bank she doesn\u2019t use. The scene's angle is slightly above eye level, emphasizing her reaction and the absurdity of the situation. The atmosphere is light-hearted, capturing the blend of confusion and humor in receiving such an unexpected message.",
