She is positioned slightly to the side, facing forward, with a welcoming and informative expression. Her eyes convey curiosity and assurance. In the background, a large, glowing digital padlock hovers above a computer screen displaying a stylized web browser. The screen prominently features a green lock icon, symbolizing a secure 'https' connection. Soft, ambient lighting highlights the character and the lock, creating a sense of trust and security. The color scheme is a blend of blues and greens, reinforcing the safe and secure theme. The setting should be dynamic and engaging, suitable for an Instagram story format.",
