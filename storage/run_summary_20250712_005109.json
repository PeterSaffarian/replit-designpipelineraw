The warm, ambient lighting casts a soft glow around her, highlighting her puzzled expression as she looks at her smartphone screen. The scene captures the moment of realization, with her eyebrows raised and a slight frown forming. In the background, blurred figures of other patrons and the soft decor of the caf\u00e9 create a relaxed atmosphere. On her phone, an exaggerated, cartoonish text bubble is visible, hinting at a suspicious message with a bank logo she doesn\u2019t recognize, adding a humorous touch to the scenario. The camera angle is slightly over-the-shoulder, focusing on her reaction and the phone screen, illustrating the concept of receiving a scam text.",
