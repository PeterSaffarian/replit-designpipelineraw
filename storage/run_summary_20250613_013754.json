The character looks worried, with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth, glancing at a stack of unopened mail labeled \"Tax Documents\" on a cluttered desk.

Scattered papers and a coffee mug add to the sense of urgency. The mood is tense yet informative, emphasizing the importance of filing tax returns on time.",
