The main character, dressed in a casual brown t-shirt and dark pants, is seated comfortably on a plush sofa, holding a smartphone with a surprised expression on her face. Her eyebrows are raised, and her eyes are wide as she stares at the screen. The room is tastefully decorated with indoor plants and a small coffee table, adding a homely feel. On the phone screen, a message notification icon is visible, symbolizing the scam text. The camera angle is slightly over-the-shoulder, focusing on her reaction to convey the unexpected and puzzling nature of the situation.",
