She is seated at a cozy wooden table in a sunlit kitchen, surrounded by potted plants and soft pastel walls. The warm morning light filters through a nearby window, casting gentle shadows. The character is glancing at her smartphone with an amused yet puzzled expression, eyebrows slightly raised and a half-smile forming, as she reads a suspicious message claiming to be from an unfamiliar bank. Her body is slightly leaned forward, capturing her curiosity and disbelief. The scene captures a moment of everyday life, highlighting the absurdity and humor in receiving such scam texts, all while maintaining a light and airy atmosphere.",
