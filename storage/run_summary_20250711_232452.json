They are wearing the same rust-colored shirt and dark pants as in the reference image. The room is softly decorated with a comfortable couch and a small coffee table, creating a relaxed atmosphere. The phone screen is subtly visible, displaying a suspicious text message claiming to be from a bank. The background showcases a few green indoor plants, adding a touch of freshness to the scene. The character's eyebrows are slightly raised, and their mouth is just open, conveying a moment of disbelief and curiosity as they realize the message is a scam. The angle is slightly over-the-shoulder, focusing on their reaction while providing a glimpse of the room, emphasizing the personal intrusion of the scam in the comfort of their home.",
