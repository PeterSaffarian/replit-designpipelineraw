She is seated at a modern desk with a laptop open, displaying a colorful and clear payslip from New Zealand on the screen. The room is softly lit with natural sunlight streaming through a nearby window, casting gentle shadows. The character, with curly black hair and wearing a casual rust-colored shirt, appears focused yet relaxed, her expression attentive as she points to various parts of the payslip with a stylus. Surrounding her are elements that emphasize learning and understanding, such as sticky notes and a small whiteboard with key financial terms.
