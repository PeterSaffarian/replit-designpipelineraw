She stands in a lively New Zealand caf\u00e9, surrounded by greenery and wooden decor, with large windows letting in soft, natural light. The camera angle is slightly tilted to add a playful touch. The character has a contemplative yet amused expression, as she gestures with one hand, embodying the phrase \"yeah nah!\" Her expression and body language convey the humor and subtlety of the slang. The caf\u00e9 buzzes with light chatter in the background, evoking a warm and friendly atmosphere that captures the essence of New Zealand's casual, laid-back culture.",
