        "artwork_prompt": "Create an image in an animated style featuring a confident character standing in a modern, well-lit office environment. The character, a young woman with shoulder-length, wavy dark hair, is wearing a smart casual outfit: an orange t-shirt and dark trousers. She is intently examining her smartphone with a focused expression, highlighting her awareness and vigilance. Around her, subtle visual cues suggest scam warning signs: a pop-up bubble with a suspicious-looking phone number, an exclamation mark, and a question mark symbol. The background features a desk with a laptop open, displaying a generic interface without text, and a potted plant adding a touch of greenery. The lighting is bright and natural, casting soft shadows, creating a professional and informative atmosphere that aligns with the theme of identifying scam warnings."
