Step 1: Generating the Initial Video Segment from an Image
The first step is to generate your base video clip from a static image. RunwayML's image_to_video.create() method is used for this.

Key Parameters:

model: Specify the generative model. gen4_turbo is recommended for image-to-video tasks due to its quality and consistency features.   

prompt_image: The input image. This can be provided as a URL (e.g., https://example.com/your_image.jpg) or as a base64 encoded data URI for local files.   

prompt_text (Optional): A text prompt to guide the video generation. This helps the model interpret the image and introduce specific movements or elements.   

ratio: The aspect ratio of the output video (e.g., '1280:720' for 16:9, '1920:1080'). Gen-4 supports multiple aspect ratios and can automatically adhere to the closest one to your image.   

duration: The length of the video segment in seconds. For gen4_turbo, initial generations are typically 5 seconds. For Gen-3 Alpha/Turbo, videos can be up to 20 seconds; anything longer will be trimmed.   

Python Code Example (Initial Generation):

Python

import os
import base64
from runwayml import RunwayML, TaskFailedError
import time # For polling task status

# --- Configuration ---
# Replace with your actual RunwayML API key
# It's recommended to store this securely, e.g., in an environment variable
RUNWAY_API_KEY = os.getenv("RUNWAY_API_KEY", "YOUR_RUNWAY_API_KEY")

client = RunwayML(api_key=RUNWAY_API_KEY)

# --- Input Image (Choose one method) ---
# Option 1: Using an image URL
image_input_url = 'https://example.com/your_initial_image.jpg' # Replace with your image URL

# Option 2: Using a local image file (base64 encoded)
# image_file_path = './your_local_image.png' # Replace with your local image path
# try:
#     with open(image_file_path, "rb") as f:
#         base64_image = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")
#     image_input_data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}"
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print(f"Error: Image file not found at {image_file_path}")
#     exit()

# --- Video Generation Parameters ---
initial_prompt = "A serene landscape with a gentle breeze, golden hour lighting."
aspect_ratio = "1280:720" # 16:9 aspect ratio
segment_duration = 5 # seconds (Gen-4 Turbo typically generates 5s clips)

print("Starting initial video generation...")
try:
    initial_task = client.image_to_video.create(
        model='gen4_turbo',
        prompt_image=image_input_url, # Or image_input_data_uri if using local file
        prompt_text=initial_prompt,
        ratio=aspect_ratio,
        duration=segment_duration,
    )
    
    # Wait for the task to complete and get the output
    # The.wait_for_task_output() method handles polling for you
    initial_video_output = initial_task.wait_for_task_output()
    
    initial_video_url = initial_video_output.url
    print(f"Initial video segment generated: {initial_video_url}")

except TaskFailedError as error:
    print(f"The initial video generation failed: {error.taskDetails}")
    exit()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred during initial generation: {e}")
    exit()

# You can now download this initial video segment if needed
# import requests
# response = requests.get(initial_video_url)
# with open("segment_0.mp4", "wb") as f:
#     f.write(response.content)
# print("Initial video segment saved as segment_0.mp4")
Step 2: Extending Videos by Chaining Segments
RunwayML doesn't have a single "extend video" API call like some other platforms. Instead, you achieve longer videos by chaining multiple shorter segments. The strength of RunwayML, particularly with its Gen-4 model, lies in its ability to maintain consistency across these chained segments.   

The general workflow for chaining is:

Generate the first segment.

For subsequent segments, use a reference (e.g., the original image, or a keyframe/description derived from the end of the previous segment) and a new prompt to guide the continuation of the scene.

Concatenate all generated segments using an external tool like FFmpeg.

Key to Consistency:

RunwayML's Gen-4 model is designed to maintain:

Infinite character consistency with a single reference image.   

Consistent objects across different locations and conditions.   

Coherent world environments while preserving style and mood.   

The ability to regenerate elements from multiple perspectives.   

This means you can often reuse your initial prompt_image or a consistent character/scene reference image for subsequent generations to ensure visual continuity. Your prompt_text will then describe the evolution of the scene.

Python Code Example (Chaining Segments):

This example demonstrates a conceptual loop for generating multiple segments. You'll need to adapt the prompt_text for each segment to guide the narrative progression.

Python

import os
import base64
from runwayml import RunwayML, TaskFailedError
import time
import subprocess # For running FFmpeg

# --- Configuration (assuming client is already initialized from Step 1) ---
# RUNWAY_API_KEY = os.getenv("RUNWAY_API_KEY", "YOUR_RUNWAY_API_KEY")
# client = RunwayML(api_key=RUNWAY_API_KEY)

# --- Parameters for Chaining ---
# The target total video length (e.g., 20-60 seconds)
target_total_duration = 30 # seconds
segment_duration = 5 # seconds per generated clip (Gen-4 Turbo default)
num_segments = target_total_duration // segment_duration

# List to store URLs of generated segments
generated_segment_urls =

# Assuming initial_video_url and image_input_url are from Step 1
# For best consistency, often reuse the original prompt_image or a consistent character reference.
consistent_reference_image = image_input_url # Or a URL to a consistent character/scene image

# Define prompts for each segment to guide the story
# Adjust these prompts to create a coherent narrative progression
segment_prompts =

# Ensure you have enough prompts for the desired number of segments
if len(segment_prompts) < num_segments:
    print(f"Warning: Not enough specific prompts for {num_segments} segments. Reusing last prompt.")
    # Extend prompts list by repeating the last one if needed
    segment_prompts.extend([segment_prompts[-1]] * (num_segments - len(segment_prompts)))

print(f"\nStarting generation of {num_segments} video segments...")

for i in range(num_segments):
    current_prompt = segment_prompts[i]
    print(f"Generating segment {i+1}/{num_segments} with prompt: '{current_prompt}'")
    
    try:
        task = client.image_to_video.create(
            model='gen4_turbo',
            prompt_image=consistent_reference_image, # Use consistent reference for continuity
            prompt_text=current_prompt,
            ratio=aspect_ratio,
            duration=segment_duration,
        )
        
        segment_output = task.wait_for_task_output()
        segment_url = segment_output.url
        generated_segment_urls.append(segment_url)
        print(f"Segment {i+1} generated: {segment_url}")
        
        # Optional: Download each segment
        # response = requests.get(segment_url)
        # with open(f"segment_{i}.mp4", "wb") as f:
        #     f.write(response.content)
        # print(f"Segment {i} saved as segment_{i}.mp4")

    except TaskFailedError as error:
        print(f"Segment {i+1} generation failed: {error.taskDetails}")
        # Decide how to handle failure: retry, skip, or exit
        break # Exit loop on first failure for this example
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred during segment {i+1} generation: {e}")
        break

print("\nAll segments generated (or process interrupted).")
print("Generated segment URLs:", generated_segment_urls)

# --- Step 3: Concatenate Videos using FFmpeg ---
if len(generated_segment_urls) > 1:
    print("\nConcatenating video segments using FFmpeg...")
    
    # Create a text file listing all video segments
    # FFmpeg requires a specific format for concatenation
    with open("concat_list.txt", "w") as f:
        for url in generated_segment_urls:
            # You would typically download the videos first and then concatenate local files
            # For this example, we'll assume you've downloaded them as segment_0.mp4, segment_1.mp4, etc.
            # Replace with actual downloaded file paths if you implement download
            f.write(f"file '{url}'\n") # If FFmpeg can directly read URLs (less common/reliable)
            # Or, if you downloaded them:
            # f.write(f"file 'segment_{generated_segment_urls.index(url)}.mp4'\n")

    # FFmpeg command to concatenate videos
    # This assumes you have downloaded the files locally and named them sequentially (e.g., segment_0.mp4, segment_1.mp4)
    # You would need to modify the 'concat_list.txt' creation above to point to local files.
    
    # Example FFmpeg command (assuming local files are downloaded)
    # ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i concat_list.txt -c copy final_extended_video.mp4
    
    # For demonstration, let's just print the command that would be run
    ffmpeg_command =
    
    print(f"To concatenate, run this command in your terminal (after downloading segments):")
    print(" ".join(ffmpeg_command))
    print("\nNote: You must download the video segments from the URLs first for FFmpeg to work locally.")
    print("Each segment is typically an MP4 (H.264) file.[7]")

else:
    print("Not enough segments generated to concatenate.")

print("\nRunwayML video extension process complete.")
Key Considerations for Seamless Extensions
Prompt Engineering for Continuity:

Each prompt_text for a new segment should logically follow the previous one. Think of it as writing a script for a continuous scene.

Focus on describing the progression of action, camera movement, or environmental changes.

RunwayML's models are good at understanding prompts and maintaining consistency, but clear and consistent prompting is key.   

Reference Images for Consistency:

For character or object consistency, it's highly effective to use the same initial reference image (prompt_image) for all segments. This helps the model maintain the visual identity of subjects across different generated clips.   

If the scene changes significantly, you might consider using a keyframe from the end of the previous video as the prompt_image for the next, but this requires extracting frames and re-uploading them, adding complexity. Reusing the original reference image is often simpler and effective with Gen-4.

Output Concatenation (FFmpeg):

RunwayML provides URLs for each generated video segment. You will need to download these segments to your local machine.

FFmpeg is the standard tool for concatenating video files. You'll create a text file (e.g., concat_list.txt) listing the paths to your downloaded video files, and then use an FFmpeg command like ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i concat_list.txt -c copy output.mp4.

Ensure all segments have the same resolution and aspect ratio for seamless concatenation.
